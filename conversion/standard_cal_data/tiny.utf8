Tiny Tom was walking in the park with his mom when he suddenly saw a huge well. He looked up at his mom with excitement and asked, "What is that well mommy?". His mom smiled and replied, "Well, it's a very deep hole in the ground with water at the bottom, sweetheart".
Tom couldn't believe his eyes. He wanted to see what was in the huge well. So he stepped closer to the edge and took a look inside. Suddenly, he lost his footing and was about to fall in the well. His mom quickly ran to him and grabbed him, just in time.
Tom started to cry and his mom hugged him tightly. She then said, "I know you are curious, Tom, but it can be dangerous to investigate things without knowing them. Let's take a quick break to calm down.
Tom sighed, and looked away, embarrassed. He realized he had done something wrong and said sorry to his mom. Together, they returned home and his mom reminded him that curiosity was a good thing but it's important to always be careful.
